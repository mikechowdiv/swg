This application was to create a a site, "Shack Up!" which allows people to list their shacks on their properties for people to express interest in to rent. Like an AirBNB for people who like to rough it in shacks.

Planning: To prepare for collaborative work on a more complex application I developed planning documents that included a UML diagram, wireframes, and a database schema. 

Building: This is a full-stack multi-tier MVC application with SQL-Server on the back-end, an ADO package for our models. The app provides basic CRUD functionality using AJAX and jQuery to populate the respective page.

Testing: Unit tests using NUnits.
